(A) Governance – economic exchange (buy a product, pay money)
Market governance
Intermediate governance
Hierarchical governance
If hierarchical governance is expensive, they must consider
• Level of specific investment
• Cost of developing these capabilities
• Cost of acquiring a firm with these capabilities.

Are there situations where intermediate governance is affected by market governance? (or can the governances be mixed?)

e.g. a plastic company has a partnership with supplier who makes plastic using oil. The supplier manufactures plastic using oil (from market governance). Therefore, pricing will fluctuate for the plastic company.

2024-12-04 11:11:27.356984 - Ze Hou (@monkeyyey): South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing anger and opposition from multiple quarters following his decision to impose martial law, an order he backtracked on just hours later.

Protesters are out on the streets this Wednesday (Dec 4) morning, calling for his resignation, while key members of Yoon's team have offered to quit en masse.

His shock decision on Tuesday night to declare martial law - the first time for South Korea in over four decades - caught nearly everyone by surprise, including politicians and the country's closest allies around the world.

Earlier, Yoon said opposition parties had taken the parliamentary process hostage, adding that there was a need to "safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces".

However, he did not give details of the North's threats.

Follow the latest developments:

Which country is this happening in?
